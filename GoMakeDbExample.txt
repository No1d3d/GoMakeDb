#First line of this file should always be #!GoMakeDB
#File name can be anything, as long as the first line is exactly #!GoMakeDB , it will work
#All the lines starting with '#' symbol after the first line, or empty lines will be ignored


#relative path should look like this: ./directory_to_create
#db_path: ./database
#name for the database should be in the format: name.db
#db_name: example.db

#this symbol sequence is used to define the start of a new TABLE creation sequence 
#---
#first you set a table_name
#table_name should not include any spaces or prohibited table naming symbols 
#table_name: People

#after it you set each column_name and column_type in one string!
#column_name should not include any spaces or prohibited column naming symbols
#column_name: id
#column_type should include only column type and descriptors
#column_type: int NOT NULL

#column_name: LastName
#column_type: varchar(255) NOT NULL

#column_name: FirstName
#column_type: varchar(255)

#column_name: Age 
#column_type: int

#if you want to create a new table to use, you simply put another "---" on an new string


#Here is a complete example of a working file


./database
example.db
---
person

id int NOT NULL
lastName varchar(255) NOT NULL
firstName varchar(255)
age int

---
socials

id int NOT NULL
person_id int NOT NULL
contact_info varchar(255) NOT NULL
status int NOT NULL CHECK (status IN (0, 1))

#This example will create a new database ./database/example.db
#This DB will have 2 Tables - person and socials
